Predicting Student Performance: A Machine Learning Approach
Welcome to my project on predicting student performance using machine learning! ðŸš€

Overview
This project leverages the power of linear regression to forecast students' grades based on various influential factors, including:

Study Hours: How much time the student spends hitting the books.

Previous Grades: Historical academic performance.

Extracurricular Activities: Involvement in activities outside the classroom.

Sleep Hours: How much rest the student gets.

Why This Matters
Predicting student performance can provide valuable insights for educators, parents, and students themselves. By understanding the factors that impact grades, we can better support students in their educational journey, tailor interventions, and drive improvements in academic outcomes.

Key Features
Data Processing: Efficient handling and transformation of categorical and numerical data.

Model Training: Implementation of a robust linear regression model.

Prediction and Evaluation: Accurate predictions of student grades with thorough evaluation metrics.

Visualization: Clear and insightful visualizations to compare predicted grades against actual performance.

Project Highlights
Data Preparation:

Handled missing values and encoded categorical features using OneHotEncoder.

Normalized feature scales to ensure accurate model training.

Model Implementation:

Trained a linear regression model on a well-structured dataset.

Evaluated model performance using test data, highlighting its predictive power.
